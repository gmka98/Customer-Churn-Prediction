# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction - Telecom Company

## 📝 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a telecom customer will churn (leave the company). By analyzing customer data such as services used, contract type, and payment method, we can build a classification model that helps telecom companies reduce customer loss through targeted retention strategies.

## 📁 Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
The dataset includes:
- Customer demographics
- Subscription information
- Service usage
- Monthly charges, tenure, and payment methods
- Target: `Churn` (Yes/No)

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
- Scikit-learn (ML modeling)
- XGBoost (advanced ML model)
- SHAP (model interpretation)

---

## 📊 Workflow

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Understand the dataset
- Detect missing or inconsistent values
- Visualize churn patterns

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical variables (OneHotEncoding)
- Scale numeric features

### 3. **Modeling**
- Train/Test split (80/20)
- Train multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Evaluate models with:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC score

### 4. **Model Interpretation**
- Use SHAP values to understand feature importance
- Visualize how each feature contributes to churn

## 📈 Expected Results

- A predictive model with up to **80%+ accuracy**
- Business insight: understand key drivers of churn (e.g., contract type, internet service, tenure)
- Interactive SHAP plots to justify predictions

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction

### 2. Install dependencies

`bash´
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run the notebook

Open and run Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

## 📌 Key Insights from the Data
Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.

Those with fiber optic internet and high monthly charges also tend to leave more.

Tenure (how long they’ve been a customer) is a strong predictor of loyalty.


## 🧠 Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

Model deployment with Streamlit or Flask

Include real-time scoring via API
